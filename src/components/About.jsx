      <h2>Our history</h2>
      <p className="p1">
        PetVet Care was founded in 2017 by a team of enthusiastic veterinarians. Starting with a small office, we have grown into a modern medical center that combines professional experience, innovative technologies, and a true love for animals. Today, all types of diagnostics, treatment and prevention of diseases are available to our clients.
